# Intuition
To make the word k-periodic, we need to find a substring of length k that can be repeated to form the word. We aim to minimize the number of operations required to achieve this.

# Approach
1. First, we iterate through the word and count the frequency of each substring of length k.
2. Then, we find the most frequent substring and its frequency.
3. The number of operations required is equal to the difference between the total number of segments in the word (n/k) and the frequency of the most frequent substring.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the word. We iterate through the word once to count the frequency of substrings.
- Space complexity: $$O(n/k)$$, where n is the length of the word and k is the length of the substring. We store the frequency of substrings in a dictionary, which can have at most n/k entries.

# Code
```

    def minimumOperationsToMakeKPeriodic(self, word, k):
        """
        :type word: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(word)
        substring_freq = {}
        
        # Iterate through the word and count the frequency of each substring of length k
        for i in range(0,n - k + 1,k):
            substring = word[i:i + k]
            substring_freq[substring] = substring_freq.get(substring, 0) + 1
        
        # Find the most frequent substring and its frequency
        max_freq = 0
        most_frequent_substring = ""
        for substring, freq in substring_freq.items():
            if freq > max_freq:
                max_freq = freq
                most_frequent_substring = substring
        return (n/k)-max_freq
