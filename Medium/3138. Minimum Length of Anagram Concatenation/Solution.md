# Intuition
To find the minimum possible length of the string t, we need to identify a substring of s that can be rearranged to form all other substrings of the same length.

# Approach
1. We iterate through the lengths of possible substrings from 1 to half the length of s (inclusive).
2. For each length, we check if it divides the length of s evenly. If not, we continue to the next length.
3. For the current length, we extract the substring from s and sort it.
4. Then, we compare this sorted substring with all other substrings of the same length, checking if they are anagrams.
5. If all substrings of the same length are anagrams, we return the length of the substring.
6. If no such substring is found, we return the length of s, indicating that no anagram can be formed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot k \log k)$$, where n is the length of s and k is the maximum length of a substring. We iterate through possible lengths and sort substrings, which takes $$O(k \log k)$$ time each.
- Space complexity: $$O(k)$$, where k is the maximum length of a substring. We store the sorted substring temporarily.

    def minAnagramLength(self, s):

        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(s)
        

        for length in range(1, n // 2 + 1):

            if n % length == 0:
                substring = s[:length]
                sorted_substring = ''.join(sorted(substring))
                all_match = True
                for check_n in range(length, n - length + 1, length):
                    sorted_s_check = ''.join(sorted(s[check_n:check_n + length]))
                    if sorted_s_check != sorted_substring:
                        all_match = False
                        break
                if all_match:
                    return length
        
        return n
